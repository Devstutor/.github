## Hi there 👋


[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) is a friendly community where you can learn to code for free. It is run by a [donor-supported 501(c)(3) nonprofit](https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate) to help millions of busy adults transition into tech.

Our full-stack web development and machine learning curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you expand your skills.

## Become a Sponsor to freeCodeCamp

In 2014, a teacher started an open source community called freeCodeCamp.org. This community has grown to include millions of developers from around the world. Together, we have built:

💻 A free 3,000-hour programming curriculum.

🏛️ Forums and chat rooms where you can get coding help and feedback on your projects.

🧪 8,000+ coding tutorials.

🎒 1,000+ free YouTube courses on Computer Science, Data Science, and Machine Learning.

We are fully donor-supported. And we are extremely capital-efficient.

Last year our budget was only about $400,000. And yet we served more than 1 billion minutes of learning.

Each dollar you give to freeCodeCamp.org translates into 50 hours worth of learning for people around the world.
